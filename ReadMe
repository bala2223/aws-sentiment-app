# AWS Sentiment Analysis App

This project is a simple Python Flask web application that performs "sentiment analysis" using "Amazon Comprehend" on AWS.  
It is hosted on an "EC2 instance" with an IAM role that grants access to Comprehend.  

When a user sends text to the '/analyze' endpoint, the app calls Amazon Comprehend’s sentiment analysis API and returns whether the sentiment is:  
✅ POSITIVE  
✅ NEGATIVE  
✅ NEUTRAL  
✅ MIXED
